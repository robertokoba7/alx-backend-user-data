Basic authentication
---
Basic authentication is an HTTP-based authentication approach and is the simplest way to secure REST APIs. It uses a Base64 format to encode usernames and passwords, both of which are stored in the HTTP header. This is an effective approach to set up various API access credentials when the priority is for an application to remain lightweight and simple.
